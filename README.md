# Amal's bio

I am an enthusiastic learner that strongly believes that knowledge can do wonders when in the right hands.

I aspire to make sure that the data available out there is used and interpreted correctly to make informed decisions and so that everything we make can be the very best.
I hold degrees in statistics, business and economics and I am now working as a product manager in an Advertising startup. Prior to product management, I worked as a data analyst in an Online Classified group. When I am not working you'll find me hiking, rock climbing, exploring the world or curled up watching movies.
